# Experiment-2

Aim : Study of list in python

Theory :List of List Commands Used
List creation using square brackets []
print()
Indexing (positive and negative)
Slicing
List item assignment (modification)
append()
insert()
extend()
len()
max()
min()
sum()
sorted()
remove()
Average calculation using sum() and len() ==> print(sum(marks)/len(marks))

Algorithm:
Algorithm 1: List Creation and Access Operations
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Create lists containing different data types such as strings, integers, and boolean values.
Step 3: Display the lists using the print() function.
Step 4: Access list elements using index positions (positive and negative indexing).
Step 5: Extract specific elements using slicing operations.
Step 6: Add and remove new elements to a list using append(), remove(), insert() methods.
Step 7: Perform list operations such as finding length, maximum, minimum, sum, and sorted order.
Step 8: Modify an element in the list by assigning a new value to a specific index.
Step 9: Stop the program.

Algorithm 2: List Manipulation and Analysis
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Create lists for fruits, marks, and grocery items.
Step 3: Add and remove new elements to a list using append(), remove(), insert() methods.
Step 4: Combine two lists using the extend() method.
Step 5: Remove specific items from the list using remove().
Step 6: Display the final updated lists and results.
Step 7: Stop the program.

Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates the use of Python lists for storing multiple values in a single variable.
It explains various list operations such as accessing elements, modifying values, adding and removing items, and performing mathematical operations.
Overall, the study helps in understanding how lists make data handling easy and efficient in Python programming.
